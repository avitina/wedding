      <p>We are planning an extended wedding trip to Australia and New Zealand towards the end of the year, and since we both value experiences over things, we would be super-happy if our wedding gifts were mostly adventure-presents. (This type of presents would also be easier to transport back to Denmark)</p>
      <p>If you would like to chip into our wedding trip or some of the activities we are planning during the trip, please see below</p>
      <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="gift in gifts">
          <div>
            <p>{{gift.title}} - {{gift.amount}} EUR</p>
            <button ng-click="increment(gift, 10)" >+</button>
            <button  ng-click="decrement(gift, 10)" >-</button>
            <img ng-src="img/{{gift.img}}" />
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you provide your mailing address along with your adventure-present, we will make sure to send you a little postcard thank-you greeting from the respective destination!</p>
      <input ng-model="email" type="text"></input>
      <button ng-click="pay(gifts)" >Pay {{total}} EUR</button>
